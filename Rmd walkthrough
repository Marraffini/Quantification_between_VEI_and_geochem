What rmd and bases you need 

AVO :

Need avo.Rmd to have a clean dataset after, that you can work with for the models or anything like that. 

Need the rmd : avo - mean 2
	 	   - sd 200
	 	   - mean + sd 200

To have the code with the splitting, alr transformation, scaling, you need to use the rmd above. 

Need the raw AVO_GEOCHEM_21052025.csv database. 


GVP :

To have data with only VEI 7, need to use :
- GVP VEI 7 (corrected).rmd

With the databases : 
GVP.xlsx
GVP_Volcano_List.csv
All six of the [name of rock]_rocks_all_info.csv


GEOROC :

You need : 
For scripts : all the rmd linked to a rock type name (idk if I have to put the rmds here tho ?)

For databases : all_georoc_databases.zip





What does the georoc avo.rmd do ?

--> It has some figures comparing the georoc database with the avo one.
